Welcome to AI Compiler, a project aimed at building an intelligent compiler that leverages AI models, LLVM optimization, and performance analysis to enhance code compilation and execution. This repository is a monorepo containing both the frontend (ai-frontend) and backend (backend) components of the project.

Project Overview

The AI Compiler project integrates artificial intelligence with traditional compiler techniques to optimize and enhance the compilation process. Key features include:

AI-driven code optimization using machine learning models.
LLVM-based optimization for efficient code generation.
Performance analysis to benchmark and improve compilation speed.
Comprehensive documentation for future scalability.
